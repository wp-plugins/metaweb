== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use the Metaweb plugin? =

The Metaweb plugin offers you a faster and more convenient way to add Metaweb TopicBlocks to your WordPress blog posts. Without it, you need to visit the TopicBlocks generator page each time you want to add a TopicBlock to a post.

= How much does it cost to use the Metaweb plugin? =

Nothing. TopicBlocks and the Metaweb plugin are both free.

= Do I need to create an account to use the Metaweb plugin? =

No, you do not need to create an account to use the Metaweb plugin.

= How do I insert TopicBlocks into individual blog posts? =

Once you’ve installed the plugin, a small Metaweb icon will appear as an “Upload / Insert” option on your WordPress Edit Post page. Clicking on the Metaweb button brings up a panel prompting you to select a topic (e.g., Avatar).  Choose a topic to generate a TopicBlock that you can then customize. When you’re done, just click the Insert button to add the TopicBlock to your blog post.  

= How do I automatically add TopicBlocks to my posts whenever I tag? =

To have TopicBlocks automatically inserted whenever you use certain tags, you need to “connect” these tags to the relevant topics accessible through Metaweb.  For example, by connecting your “anne_hathaway” tag to the Metaweb topic Anne Hathaway, you are creating a rule that says “whenever I tag a blog post with “anne_hathaway” insert an Anne Hathaway TopicBlock at the bottom of the post for me.” 
Connecting a tag to Metaweb is simple.  If you’ve installed the plugin, a “Connect Tags to Metaweb” button will appear on your WordPress tag management page. Clicking on that button will bring up a panel allowing you to connect your tags to Metaweb. To connect a tag, find the Metaweb topic that your tag represents and click “Connect”. 

= What if I can’t find the topic I’m looking for? =

If you’re unable to find the topic your tag represents, it means that Metaweb doesn’t have any information about that topic. In that case, you should just leave that tag unconnected by clicking the “skip” button.

= Should I connect all of my tags to Metaweb? =
It’s entirely up to you, but in general, tags related to specific people, places or things like “Barack Obama” or “Mad Men” are most appropriate for connecting to Metaweb.  Metaweb works less well for more general categorization tags like “reviews”, “economy”, or “stuff I think is cool” since the content Metaweb has that’s related to these categories is less likely to be relevant to the topics of your posts. 

= Where exactly will TopicBlocks appear if I set them up to automatically appear whenever I tag? =

At the bottom of every post that is tagged with the connected tag. 

= If I connect a tag to Metaweb, do TopicBlocks show up in old posts that have been tagged with that tag? =

Yes.  

= Why can't I customize TopicBlocks that are added when I tag? =

To streamline the process of automatically adding TopicBlocks to your posts when you tag, customization is currently not available.  If you do want customization options, they are available to you if you add TopicBlocks to individual posts without tagging.  

= What blogging platforms is the plugin available for? =

Currently, the plugin is only available for WordPress.org. If you’re interested in seeing support for another platform, let us know by emailing us here.

= How do I uninstall the Metaweb plugin? =

To uninstall the Metaweb plugin, follow these instructions:
1. In your Plugins page, click on the ‘Deactivate’ button under Metaweb. This will stop the plugin from being operational in your site.
2. You can further delete the plugin but deleting the ‘Metaweb’ directory under /wp-content/plugins/ where you installed it.

= I can’t find the answer to my question here. Where can I go to get it answered? =

Email us here to let us know your specific question and we’ll get back to you as soon as we can.

= What is TopicBlocks? = 

TopicBlocks is a unique and easy way to add images, facts, news, and other related content from across the Web to your blog posts or articles.  Just select a topic – like Lindsay Lohan or Avatar and quickly get rich, relevant, free content to keep your readers engaged.  

= Why should I use TopicBlocks? =

Web users are always looking for a greater variety of content – pictures, videos, news, facts, bios, Twitter streams, and more.  TopicBlocks is a quick and easy way to give your readers access to all of that content directly on your site, in a visually appealing and compact way.  Your readers will be happier, more engaged, and spend more time on your site as a result.  

= How do I use TopicBlocks? =
Using TopicBlocks is easy.  Just choose a topic (like an actor or a movie) and TopicBlocks will automatically grab content related to that topic – images, facts, news, social network links, movie trailers and more – and package it into a single block that you can add to your blog post. 

= How is TopicBlocks different from other blog enhancement tools out there? =

Most blog enhancement tools rely on keyword search, which works well in some circumstances but often falls short when there are multiple matches for a search item.  For example, if you want to find the Twitter stream and Facebook page for Jessica Alba, a search using the keyword “Jessica Alba” will return several options, but there is no definitive way to know which is the correct result.  TopicBlocks removes this ambiguity by linking content to unique identifiers rather than text – TopicBlocks clearly identifies the exact Twitter ID and Facebook page corresponding to the search you are looking for.  This means you get the right content every time and none of the unrelated content that often surfaces from regular keyword searches.

= Where does the content in TopicBlocks come from? =

TopicBlocks draws content from a variety of sources.  Some examples include:
* Freebase (images, facts, and some topic descriptions).  
* Wikipedia (descriptions)
* Rotten Tomatoes (movie reviews)
* Metacritic (movie reviews) 
* Daylife (news)
* Twitter (celebrity tweets)
* Facebook (celebrity fan pages)
* And many, many more.

= Where do the links in TopicBlocks go? =
It depends on the link, but in general the links in TopicBlocks take readers to the source of the information – whether that is Twitter, Wikipedia, Rotten Tomatoes, or any of the other quality content sources we connect to.
= How will TopicBlocks impact my search engine ranking? =

The content in TopicBlocks is delivered in an iframe, which search engines generally do not crawl.  Because of this, the direct impact on search engine rankings should be fairly minimal.
That said, using TopicBlocks effectively can make your site more engaging – increasing your average time on site and decreasing your bounce rate. Over time, improving these types of metrics tends to improve search engine rankings.

= Can I insert more than one TopicBlock into my blog post? =

Yes, you can add as many TopicBlocks as you want.

= What configurability options are available? =

Each time you embed a TopicBlock you can choose which specific content blocks you’d like to include.  You can also choose between a single-block and a double-block configuration.  
We are working on several other configuration options that aren’t available yet, including the ability to change the image and the option to construct different configurations of blocks.  If you’d like to be notified when these options are made available, sign up for our email list.  
If you have ideas for other features you’d like us to add, send an email to let us know - we would love to hear from you!

= Can I make money from the merchant links in TopicBlocks? =

Currently, this is not an option.  We are developing a platform to enable revenue sharing, but it’s not quite ready yet.  

= Will TopicBlocks render properly in RSS readers such as Feedburner and Google Reader? =

In RSS readers, TopicBlocks will render just an image of the topic instead of the entire contents of the TopicBlocks due to limitations of RSS readers. 


= What is Metaweb? =

Metaweb is a content integration network that contains keys, identifiers, and mappings for millions of topics across dozens of websites.  Metaweb enables site owners and publishers to easily and intelligently enhance their pages and distribute their content across the Web. 

Metaweb does this by utilizing Freebase, our large, open database of things in the world.  Freebase has information on over 11 million things, including movies, books, TV shows, celebrities, locations, companies, and more.  Using Freebase, we provide developers with an easy way to access third party content, because it knows what IDs different sites use to refer to the same object.  For example, you can ask Metaweb for Justin Timberlake’s latest Twitter updates or his top songs from Last.fm, without having to know that his Twitter username is “jtimberlake” or that his Last.fm ID is “Justin+Timberlake.”  Similarly, you can ask Metaweb for all the most popular recent articles about Jay Leno or The Tonight Show, and Metaweb will automatically grab relevant content from a variety of sources.  Metaweb stores this information under the hood, which enables publishers and site owners to enjoy the benefits of this network with just a single mapping of their topic IDs.

Sites like Bing and the Wall Street Journal, in addition to bloggers and site owners everywhere, are using Metaweb in all sorts of ways to make their content smarter, more discoverable, and better connected.

= Where does Freebase data come from? =

Our internal data team seeded Freebase with information from a variety of high-quality open data sources.  Our engineers continue to play a critical role in bulk, algorithmic data imports, data extraction from free text, ongoing synchronization of data feeds, and rigorous quality management.  Reconciliation of entities across data sources is a core part of the technology Metaweb has developed.
The most important source of our data, however, is our community.  Individuals around the world are improving Freebase as we speak, curating the data and extending it to new domains.  Partners also play an important role, loading their data sets into Freebase and mapping in their identifiers.

= How big is your community of contributors? =

The Freebase community is made up of incredibly passionate users across the globe.  The total size is probably in the tens of thousands, but like any UGC site, some users are more active than others.  The editorial teams of partner sites also play an important role in building out and improving the database.

= What motivates people to contribute to Freebase? =

Each user’s reasons are different – some are eager to share their specific piece of knowledge with the world, others are excited to be a part of the community, and many are just excited about the prospect of what we are doing.
On the partner front, they’re usually doing it to syndicate their data, or to link their pages to Freebase so that they can use Freebase content on their site.
In addition to community moderation, we offer a wide range of tools to help ensure that Freebase data is always of the highest quality – particularly when it is being used on other websites.

= How do you control for data quality? =

Internally, we’re very careful when we import data.  We use both automated and manual processes to make sure that we are reconciling entities correctly and only loading the highest quality data.
The community also plays a very important role in this process, using tools and watchlists to keep an eye on the data and quickly correct any mistakes that have been made.
In addition, we have a wide range of tools that site owners can use to ensure that the data on their site meets their quality standards and is locked down upon going live to prevent future changes.  These tools have allowed us to earn the trust of large publishers, search engines, and social networks.  

= What verticals does Freebase focus on? =

Freebase has information on over 11 million entities spanning a wide range of categories – everything from movie stars to recipes to scientific data.  For all these entities, Freebase has facts, images, descriptions, links to related content on the web, and collections of related entities.
