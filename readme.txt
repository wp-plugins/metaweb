== Description ==

The Metaweb plugin is a WordPress plugin that allows you to easily add Metaweb TopicBlocks to your blog posts directly from within WordPress. You can quickly add TopicBlocks to individual blog posts or have TopicBlocks automatically inserted whenever you use certain tags.  

TopicBlocks is a unique and easy way to add images, facts, news, and other related content to your posts.  Just select a topic - like Taylor Swift or Avatar - and automatically get movie trailers, Twitter feeds, movie reviews, celebrity gossip, images, and tons of other content.  TopicBlocks automatically packages all this into a widget you can add to your blog in seconds.  It's an easy way to add compelling content to your blog and keep your readers more engaged.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use the Metaweb plugin? =

The Metaweb plugin offers you a faster and more convenient way to add Metaweb TopicBlocks to your WordPress blog posts. Without it, you need to visit the [TopicBlocks generator page](http://www.metaweb.com/topicblocks) each time you want to add a TopicBlock to a post.

= What is TopicBlocks? = 

TopicBlocks is a unique and easy way to add images, facts, news, and other related content from across the Web to your blog posts or articles.  Just select a topic – like Lindsay Lohan or Avatar and quickly get rich, relevant, free content to keep your readers engaged.  

= How much does it cost to use the Metaweb plugin? =

Nothing. TopicBlocks and the Metaweb plugin are both free.

= Do I need to create an account to use the Metaweb plugin? =

No, you do not need to create an account to use the Metaweb plugin.

= How do I insert TopicBlocks into individual blog posts? =

Once you’ve installed the plugin, a small Metaweb icon will appear as an “Upload / Insert” option on your WordPress Edit Post page. Clicking on the Metaweb button brings up a panel prompting you to select a topic (e.g., Avatar).  Choose a topic to generate a TopicBlock that you can then customize. When you’re done, just click the Insert button to add the TopicBlock to your blog post.  

= How do I automatically add TopicBlocks to my posts whenever I tag? =

To have TopicBlocks automatically inserted whenever you use certain tags, you need to “connect” these tags to the relevant topics accessible through Metaweb.  For example, by connecting your “anne_hathaway” tag to the Metaweb topic Anne Hathaway, you are creating a rule that says “whenever I tag a blog post with “anne_hathaway” insert an Anne Hathaway TopicBlock at the bottom of the post for me.” 
Connecting a tag to Metaweb is simple.  If you’ve installed the plugin, a “Manage Tag Connections” button will appear on your WordPress tag management page. Clicking on that button will bring up a panel allowing you to connect your tags to Metaweb. To connect a tag, find the Metaweb topic that your tag represents and click “Connect”. 

= What if I can’t find the topic I’m looking for? =

If you’re unable to find the topic your tag represents, it means that Metaweb doesn’t have any information about that topic. In that case, you should just leave that tag unconnected by clicking the “skip” button.

= Should I connect all of my tags to Metaweb? =
It’s entirely up to you, but in general, tags related to specific people, places or things like “Barack Obama” or “Mad Men” are most appropriate for connecting to Metaweb.  Metaweb works less well for more general categorization tags like “reviews”, “economy”, or “stuff I think is cool” since the content Metaweb has that’s related to these categories is less likely to be relevant to the topics of your posts. 

= Where exactly will TopicBlocks appear if I set them up to automatically appear whenever I tag? =

At the bottom of every post that is tagged with the connected tag. 

= If I connect a tag to Metaweb, do TopicBlocks show up in old posts that have been tagged with that tag? =

Yes.  

= Why can't I customize TopicBlocks that are added when I tag? =

To streamline the process of automatically adding TopicBlocks to your posts when you tag, customization is currently not available.  If you do want customization options, they are available to you if you add TopicBlocks to individual posts without tagging.  

= How do I uninstall the Metaweb plugin? =

To uninstall the Metaweb plugin, follow these instructions:

1. In your Plugins page, click on the ‘Deactivate’ button under Metaweb. This will stop the plugin from being operational in your site.
2. You can further delete the plugin by clicking 'Delete' under Metaweb after deactivating it. 

No blog data (such as posts or tags) will be lost as a result of un-installing the plugin, but any TopicBlocks that you have embedded using the plugin (either via a tag or manually) will not be displayed in your pages anymore. 

= I can’t find the answer to my question here. Where can I go to get it answered? =

If you have additional questions or problems, email us at help@metaweb.com.  For general thoughts, ideas, and suggestions, email us at feedback@metaweb.com.

= How will TopicBlocks impact my search engine ranking? =

Much of the content in TopicBlocks is delivered in an iframe, which search engines do not crawl.  However, some links in TopicBlocks are directly embedded in your web page, and search engines can crawl and understand these links.  Because these links are to well-known web pages - for example, a link to a Wikipedia, Netflix, or New York Times page - they help search engines understand what your page is about and can therefore help search rankings.  

= Can I insert more than one TopicBlock into my blog posts? =

Yes, you can add as many TopicBlocks as you want.

= What configurability options are available? =

Each time you embed a TopicBlock you can choose which specific content blocks you’d like to include.  You can also choose between a single-block and a double-block configuration.  

If you have ideas for other features you’d like us to add, email us at feedback@metaweb.com to let us know - we would love to hear from you!

= Can I make money from the merchant links in TopicBlocks? =

Currently, this is not an option.  We are developing a platform to enable revenue sharing, but it’s not quite ready yet.  

= Will TopicBlocks render properly in RSS readers such as Feedburner and Google Reader? =

In RSS readers, TopicBlocks will render just an image of the topic instead of the entire contents of the TopicBlocks due to limitations of RSS readers.
